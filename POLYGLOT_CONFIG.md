## Installation


For cloud access through Tesla cloud service one must provide a "refresh token" (REFRESH_TOKEN).  
It can be obtained e.g. using Auth for Tesla iPhone app 
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/auth-app-for-tesla/id1552058613 or Tesla Tokens https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.leveugle.teslatokens

Once the token is accepted the node server will try to keep the token refreshed.  Note, the token is stored in a file as part of the node server

Once installed between a controller node with node status for each car registered in the user account.  Sub nodes for each car are generated addressing charging and climate control.

If additional functionality is desired contact the author through github. github.com/Panda88CO/
